| April 5 |   9-10pm   |                                                                                 I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Jan 6   | 9:20-9:55  |                                                           Thought about the code with Tyler decided on DFS started working |
| Jan 7   | 2:30-3:00  |                                    Added a bunch of Trie functions to store dictionary. Taken and modified from spellcheck |
| Jan 9   | 12:50-1:35 | Made the DFS recursively using the theory to help. Used a hashset to stop the duplicates in my goodWord set/list. Finished |
